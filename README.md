Final Project for CS134; a 3D lunar lander game, where the main goal is to land a spaceship onto the moon in a specific spot; the engine is built through code alone.

NOTE: You must have openFrameworks to use this project. Make sure to create a new project, then replace the src files in the new project with the src files in this repository, along with replacing bin/data with the objects and textures in this repository as well.
